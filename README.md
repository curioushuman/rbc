# RBC

This is a work in progress. Going back to basics to build out my own version of Nest.js & DDD informed by TDD.

## Inspiration

* [VincentJouanne/nest-clean-architecture](https://github.com/VincentJouanne/nest-clean-architecture)
  * Very tidy, very advanced combination of Nest.js & DDD

## Packages/libraries

### Runtypes

Borrowed from [VincentJouanne](https://github.com/VincentJouanne), they use it to implement very neat encapsulated Value Objects.
